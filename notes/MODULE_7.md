# Writing web tests

## Happy-path testing with UI

- Using a Docker Container for the Webdriver
- Selenium and Selenide
- Test the insertion of a review and verifying it
- Keycloak involvement (-> now we can't use/would be hard to make use of WireMock)
- Use Chrome and Firefox
- Outline the usage of browser testing solution
- JUnit 5 extension to save screenshots on failure
- Browser recording with Webdriver from Testcontainers
